**Step 3**:

**Description**: There was an option to either sign in to an account that was already made or make an account. This process was easy and led me to the next step of uploading a resume.

**Description**: I was given an option to upload my resume which is an efficient approach to uploading specific information such as address, skills, previous jobs, etc.

**Step 5**:

**Description**: After making an account, Indeed gave me suggestions to other jobs in my area that falls in the category of cybersecurity. This makes my life easier since I will only be looking for cybersecurity jobs, so Indeed just displays those jobs right away.

**Step 6**:

**Description**: When needing to change anything about my account, Indeed has a simple format on how to change any information, review anything, or if you want to quickly view jobs. A simple format and straightforward.

**Step 7**:

**Description**: Indeed allows you to update job preferences and state your job types. These options are considered when goign through jon search process. This was easy to do and did not take much time.

**Step 8**:

**Description**: A screenshot of what I view for my personal account that contains resume, job preferences, if I am open to work, and other information. Self explanatory way of doing things and was not difficult to do. This information was not required or fully necessary when job searching but helps when narrowing down options and applying is more efficient.

**Step 9**:

**Description**: On the main page of jobs displayed, Indeed provided a link straight to the applying process based off of the information I gave Indeed.

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | Indeed had a lot of straightforward approaches and was easy to follow. |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | Indeed doesn't require a user to make an account which cuts out steps that would take more time. Only using the site to search for a job nearby was time efficient. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |   2 | The process of finding a job was very clear and easy to do. However, making an account on Indeed wasn't required which could lead to some confusion for some users. |
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3 | Finding a job was very easy. I plugged in specific job type and location and easily found some job options. This was all done on the homepage of Indeed. |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 3 | There was quality white space used on Indeed. There was not an overwhelming amount of words on the page which is allows more users to read through what is displayed on the page. |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 2 | The navigation was easy to walk through. Signing up was easy to find but should be suggested more when operating as a guest on Indeed. However, being a guest or having an account, Indeed was inclusive to both with their services. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 3 | There is not a whole lot going on with the Indeed interface (a small amount of options to choose from), so most users should be able to operate easily. |

| 6 | Logout | User successfully logged out. |

## Step 3.5 Findings

**Cons**:
1. The user did not like how the results were not in order of distance.
2. A filter would have been beneficial to the searching process

**Pros**:
1. History under search bar was helpful to find previous searches
2. Turning on location services were easy due to being asked via a pop up and only needing to click a button

**Overview**:
Overall the user had a good experience and our group set the user up for a fairly easy trial. The user's feedback was beneficial and honest and will be great for our group to consider moving forward. Not much was expected from our user and they were able to complete the task with ease. Our group considers this trial a success and are eager to make positive changes moving forward.
